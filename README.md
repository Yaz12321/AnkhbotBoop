# AnkhbotBoop
A chat game for Streamlabs Chatbot: Boop. Viewers can secretly boop or poke other active viewers in chat, who would have to guess who booped them. 
A viewer would whisper the bot (should follow the bot account fist!) ![command] [viewer]. That viewer would have a set time to type in chat ![command] [guess]
